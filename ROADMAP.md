## 🎯 Priority 1: Core Mathematical Capabilities

### 🔴 1.1 Symbolic Algebra Engine

**Status:** ✅ 18/12/2025 | **Owner:** @xirf

**Tasks:**

- [x] Implement symbolic simplification
  - [x] Polynomial expansion and factorization
  - [x] Trigonometric identities (Pythagorean, even/odd functions)
  - [x] Double-angle formulas (sin(2x), cos(2x), tan(2x))
  - [x] Logarithm laws (log(ab) = log(a) + log(b))
  - [x] Rational expression simplification
- [x] Expression equivalence testing
- [x] Symbolic equation solving (linear, quadratic)
- [x] Add tests for 50+ symbolic identities (700+ tests passing)
- [x] Document simplification rules and limitations

**Rationale:** Current differentiation has basic simplification, but advanced symbolic manipulation would enable algebraic workflows and make derivative results more readable.

> [!NOTE] > **Limitations:** Despite completion status, the symbolic algebra engine uses pattern-based local simplification, not a full Computer Algebra System (CAS). It does not provide canonical forms or general term collection. See [KNOWN_ISSUES.md](doc/KNOWN_ISSUES.md) for details.

**Success Criteria:**

- [x] Can simplify `(x+1)^2` to `x^2 + 2x + 1`
- [x] Can factor `x^2 - 4` to `(x+2)(x-2)`
